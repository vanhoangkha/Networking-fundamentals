</aside> --- COMMON ATTACKS - DoS (Denial c·ªßa Service) Attacks - Spoofing Attacks - Reflection / Amplification Attacks - MAN-in-the-Middle Attacks - Reconnaissance Attacks - Malware - Social Engineering Attacks - M·∫≠t kh·∫©u-Related Attacks DoS (Denial c·ªßa Service) Attacks - DoS attacks threaten the AVAILABILITY c·ªßa the SYSTEM - One common DoS attack l√† the TCP SYN Flood - TCP Three-Way Handshake : SYN | SYN-ACK | ACK - The ATTACKER sends countless TCP SYN messages ƒë·∫øn the TARGET - The TARGET sends m·ªôt SYN-ACK message trong response ƒë·∫øn each SYN it receives - The ATTACKER never replies v·ªõi the final ACK c·ªßa the TCP Three-Way Handshake - The incomplete connections fill up the TARGET‚ÄôS TCP connection table - The ATTACKER continues sending SYN messages - The TARGET l√† no longer able ƒë·∫øn make legitimate TCP connections ![image](https://github.com/psaumur/CCNA/assets/106411237/5b04eea4-c53a-48b7-9683-952c9b27c9db) - In m·ªôt DDoS (Distributed Denial c·ªßa Service) Attack, the ATTACKER infects many computers v·ªõi MALWARE v√† uses them ƒë·∫øn initiate m·ªôt Denial-of-Service Attack. - This group c·ªßa infected computers l√† called m·ªôt BOTNET Example : A TCP SYN Flood Attack ![image](https://github.com/psaumur/CCNA/assets/106411237/fc394c8d-33f4-4fd4-84a0-3e49caa9c158) --- SPOOFING ATTACKS - To SPOOF m·ªôt ƒê·ªãa ch·ªâ l√† ƒë·∫øn use m·ªôt FAKE SOURCE ƒê·ªãa ch·ªâ (IP ho·∫∑c MAC) - Numerous attacks involve spoofing; it‚Äôs not m·ªôt SINGLE kind c·ªßa attack - An example l√† m·ªôt DHCP EXHAUSTION attack - An ATTACKER uses spoofed MAC ADDRESSES ƒë·∫øn flood DHCP Discover messages - The TARGET server‚Äôs DHCP POOL becomes full, resulting trong m·ªôt Denial-of-Service ƒë·∫øn other DEVICES ![image](https://github.com/psaumur/CCNA/assets/106411237/c539c50b-1be0-42f9-8ce3-fbeb47ea2034) --- REFLECTION / AMPLIFICATION ATTACKS - In m·ªôt REFLECTION attack, the ATTACKER sends traffic ƒë·∫øn a *reflector*, and spoofs the SOURCE c·ªßa the G√≥i tin using the TARGET‚ÄôS ƒê·ªãa ch·ªâ IP - The *reflector* (ie: a DNS Server) sends the reply ƒë·∫øn the TARGET‚ÄôS ƒê·ªãa ch·ªâ IP - If the amount c·ªßa traffic sent ƒë·∫øn the TARGET l√† large enough, this c√≥ th·ªÉ result trong m·ªôt Denial-of-Service - A REFLECTION attack becomes m·ªôt AMPLIFICATION attack when the amount c·ªßa traffic sent b·ªüi the ATTACKER l√† small but it triggers m·ªôt LARGE amount c·ªßa traffic ƒë·∫øn be sent t·ª´ the *reflector* to the TARGET ![image](https://github.com/psaumur/CCNA/assets/106411237/34ca977d-9884-4aeb-b99a-9f3677ba17fa) --- MAN-IN-THE-MIDDLE ATTACKS - In m·ªôt MAN-IN-THE-MIDDLE attack, the ATTACKER places himself between the SOURCE v√† DESTINATION ƒë·∫øn eavesdrop tr√™n communications, or ƒë·∫øn modify traffic before it reaches the DESTINATION - A common example l√† ARP SPOOFING, also known as ARP POISONING - A HOST sends m·ªôt ARP REQUEST, asking cho the ƒê·ªãa ch·ªâ MAC c·ªßa another Thi·∫øt b·ªã - The TARGET c·ªßa the request sends m·ªôt ARP REPLY, informing the requester c·ªßa it‚Äôs ƒê·ªãa ch·ªâ MAC - The ATTACKER waits v√† sends another ARP REPLY after it‚Äôs legitimate replier ![image](https://github.com/psaumur/CCNA/assets/106411237/86cee6cd-845a-4732-bfec-4cfe18101322) - In PC1‚Äôs ARP table, the entry cho 10.0.0.1 s·∫Ω have the ATTACKER‚ÄôS ƒê·ªãa ch·ªâ MAC - When PC1 tries ƒë·∫øn send traffic ƒë·∫øn SRV1, it s·∫Ω be forwarded ƒë·∫øn the ATTACKER instead - The ATTACKER c√≥ th·ªÉ inspect the messages, and then forward them tr√™n ƒë·∫øn SRV1 - The ATTACKER c√≥ th·ªÉ also modify the messages before forwarding them ƒë·∫øn SRV1 - This compromises the CONFIDENTIALITY v√† INTEGRITY c·ªßa communication between PC1 v√† SRV1 ![image](https://github.com/psaumur/CCNA/assets/106411237/07ebfebd-0686-436a-8990-853e3fee4377) --- RECONNAISSANCE ATTACKS - RECONNAISSANCE ATTACKS l√† not attacks themselves but they l√† used ƒë·∫øn gather information about m·ªôt TARGET which c√≥ th·ªÉ be used cho m·ªôt future attack - This l√† often publicly available information - IE: nslookup ƒë·∫øn learn the ƒê·ªãa ch·ªâ IP c·ªßa m·ªôt site ![image](https://github.com/psaumur/CCNA/assets/106411237/6e63b09d-a768-4cb3-ac06-87ad41d45c38) - Or m·ªôt WHOIS query ƒë·∫øn learn email addresses, phone numbers, physical addresses, etc. HTTPS://lookup.icann.org/lookup --- MALWARE - MALWARE (MALICIOUS SOFTWARE) refers ƒë·∫øn m·ªôt variety c·ªßa harmful programs that c√≥ th·ªÉ infect m·ªôt computer - VIRUSES infect other software (a ‚Äòhost program‚Äô) - The VIRUS spreads as the software l√† shared b·ªüi USERS. Typically, they CORRUPT ho·∫∑c MODIFY files tr√™n the TARGET computer - WORMS do not require m·ªôt host program. They l√† standalone malware v√† they l√† able ƒë·∫øn spread tr√™n their own, without user interaction. They spread c·ªßa WORMS c√≥ th·ªÉ congest the M·∫°ng but the ‚Äòpayload‚Äô of m·ªôt WORM c√≥ th·ªÉ cause additional harm ƒë·∫øn TARGET DEVICES - TROJAN HORSES l√† harmful software that l√† disguised as LEGITIMATE software. They l√† spread through user interaction such as opening email attachments, downloading m·ªôt file t·ª´ the Internet. The above MALWARE types c√≥ th·ªÉ exploit various VULNERABILITIES ƒë·∫øn threaten any c·ªßa the CIA c·ªßa m·ªôt TARGET Thi·∫øt b·ªã ** There l√† MANY types c·ªßa MALWARE --- SOCIAL ENGINEERING ATTACKS - SOCIAL ENGINEERING ATTACKS target the most vulnerable part c·ªßa ANY system - PEOPLE! - They involve psychological manipulation ƒë·∫øn make the TARGET reveal confidential information ho·∫∑c perform some action - PHISHING typically involves fraudulent emails that appear ƒë·∫øn come t·ª´ m·ªôt legitimate business (Amazon, bank, credit card company, etc) and contain links ƒë·∫øn m·ªôt fraudulent website that seems legitimate. Users l√† told ƒë·∫øn login ƒë·∫øn the fraudulent website, providing their login credentials ƒë·∫øn the attacker. - SPEAR PHISHING l√† m·ªôt more targeted form c·ªßa phishing, ie: aimed t·∫°i employees c·ªßa m·ªôt certain company - WHALING l√† m·ªôt phishing targeted t·∫°i high-profile individuals, ie: a company president - VISHING (Voice Phishing) is phishing performed over m·ªôt phone - SMISHING (SMS Phishing) is phishing using SMS text messages - WATERING HOLE attacks compromise sites that the TARGET victim frequently visits. If m·ªôt malicious link l√† placed tr√™n m·ªôt website the TARGET trusts, they c√≥ th·ªÉ not hesitate ƒë·∫øn click it - TAILGATING attack involves entering restricted, secured areas b·ªüi simply walking trong behind m·ªôt authorized person as they enter. Often the TARGET s·∫Ω hold the door open cho the ATTACKER ƒë·∫øn be polite, assuming the ATTACKER l√† also authorized ƒë·∫øn enter. --- M·∫≠t kh·∫©u-RELATED ATTACKS - Most systems use m·ªôt USERNAME / M·∫≠t kh·∫©u combination ƒë·∫øn AUTHENTICATE users - The USERNAME l√† often simple / easy ƒë·∫øn guess (V√≠ d·ª• the user‚Äôs email ƒê·ªãa ch·ªâ) and the strength v√† secrecy c·ªßa the M·∫≠t kh·∫©u l√† relied tr√™n ƒë·∫øn provide the necessary B·∫£o m·∫≠t - ATTACKERS c√≥ th·ªÉ learn m·ªôt user‚Äôs passwords via multiple methods: - Guessing - DICTIONARY ATTACK : - A program runs through a ‚Äòdictionary‚Äô or list c·ªßa common words / passwords ƒë·∫øn find the TARGET‚ÄôS M·∫≠t kh·∫©u - BRUTE FORCE ATTACK : - A program tries every possible combination c·ªßa letters, numbers, and special characters ƒë·∫øn find the TARGET‚ÄôS M·∫≠t kh·∫©u - STRONG PASSWORDS n√™n contain: - At LEAST 8 characters (preferably more) - A mixture c·ªßa UPPERCASE v√† LOWERCASE letters - A mixture c·ªßa LETTERS v√† NUMBERS - One c·ªßa more SPECIAL CHARACTERS (# @ ! ? etc.) - Should be CHANGED REGULARLY --- PASSWORDS / MULTI-FACTOR X√°c th·ª±c (MFA) - MULTI-FACTOR X√°c th·ª±c involves providing more than just m·ªôt USERNAME / M·∫≠t kh·∫©u ƒë·∫øn prove your identity - It usually involves providing TWO c·ªßa the following ( = Two-Factor X√°c th·ª±c) : - SOMETHING YOU KNOW - A USERNAME / M·∫≠t kh·∫©u combination, a PIN, etc. - SOMETHING YOU HAVE - Pressing m·ªôt notification that appears tr√™n your phone, a badge that l√† scanned, etc. - SOMETHING YOU ARE - Biometrics such as m·ªôt face scan, palm scan, fingerprint scan, retina scan, etc. - Requiring multiple factors c·ªßa X√°c th·ª±c greatly increases the B·∫£o m·∫≠t. Even if the ATTACKER learns the TARGET‚ÄôS M·∫≠t kh·∫©u (SOMETHING YOU KNOW), they won‚Äôt be able ƒë·∫øn login ƒë·∫øn the TARGET‚ÄôS account --- DIGITAL CERTIFICATES - DIGITAL CERTIFICATES l√† another form c·ªßa X√°c th·ª±c used ƒë·∫øn prove the identity c·ªßa the holder c·ªßa the certificate - They l√† used cho websites ƒë·∫øn verify that the website being accessed l√† legitimate - Entities that want m·ªôt certificate ƒë·∫øn prove their identity send m·ªôt CSR (CERTIFICATE SIGNING REQUEST) to m·ªôt CA (CERTIFICATE AUTHORITY) which s·∫Ω generate v√† sign the certificate --- CONTROLLING v√† Gi√°m s√°t USERS v·ªõi AAA - AAA (Triple-A) stands cho X√°c th·ª±c, ·ª¶y quy·ªÅn, and K·∫ø to√°n - It l√† m·ªôt framework cho controlling v√† monitor users c·ªßa m·ªôt computer system (ie: a M·∫°ng) - X√°c th·ª±c - Process c·ªßa verifying m·ªôt user‚Äôs identity - Logging in = X√°c th·ª±c - ·ª¶y quy·ªÅn - Process c·ªßa granting the user the appropriate Truy c·∫≠p v√† permissions - Granting the user Truy c·∫≠p ƒë·∫øn some files / services, restricting Truy c·∫≠p ƒë·∫øn other files / services = ·ª¶y quy·ªÅn - K·∫ø to√°n - Process c·ªßa recording the user‚Äôs activities tr√™n the system - Logging when m·ªôt user makes m·ªôt change ƒë·∫øn m·ªôt file = K·∫ø to√°n - Enterprises typically use m·ªôt AAA server ƒë·∫øn provide AAA services - ISE (Identity Services Engine) is Cisco‚Äôs AAA server - AAA Servers usually support the following TWO AAA Protocols: - RADIUS : Open Standard Giao th·ª©c - Uses UDP PORTS 1812 v√† 1813 - TACACS+ : Cisco Proprietary Giao th·ª©c - Uses TCP C·ªïng 49 <aside> üí° FOR THE CCNA, KNOW THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN X√°c th·ª±c, ·ª¶y quy·ªÅn, and K·∫ø to√°n </aside> --- B·∫£o m·∫≠t PROGRAM ELEMENTS - USER AWARENESS PROGRAMS l√† designed ƒë·∫øn make employees aware c·ªßa potential B·∫£o m·∫≠t threats v√† risks - USER TRAINING PROGRAMS l√† formal than USER AWARENESS PROGRAMS - PHYSICAL Truy c·∫≠p Ki·ªÉm so√°t protect equipment v√† data t·ª´ potential attackers b·ªüi only allowing authorized users into the protected areas such as M·∫°ng CLOSETS ho·∫∑c DATA CENTER FLOORS
