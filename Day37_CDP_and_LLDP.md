# 36. CDP and LLDP (Layer 2 Discovery Giao th·ª©c)

INTRO TO LAYER 2 DISCOVERY PROTOCOLS

- LAYER 2 DISCOVERY Giao th·ª©c, such as CDP and LLDP share information WITH and DISCOVER information about NEIGHBORING (Connected) DEVICES

- The SHARED INFORMATION includes:
    - Hostname
    - ƒê·ªãa ch·ªâ IP
    - Device Type
    - etcetera.

- **CDP** is a Cisco Proprietary Giao th·ª©c
- **LLDP** is an Industry Standard Giao th·ª©c (IEEE 802.1AB)

- Because they SHARE INFORMATION about the DEVICES in the M·∫°ng, they can be considered a B·∫£o m·∫≠t risk and are often NOT used. It is up to the M·∫°ng ENGINEER / ADMIN to decide if they want to use them in the M·∫°ng or not.

CISCO DISCOVERY Giao th·ª©c (CDP)

- CDP is a Cisco proprietary Giao th·ª©c
- It is enabled on Cisco devices (routers, switches, firewalls, IP Phones, etc) by M·∫∑c ƒë·ªãnh

<aside>
üí° CDP Messages are periodically sent to Multicast ƒê·ªãa ch·ªâ MAC `0100.0CCC.CCCC`

</aside>


- When a DEVICE receives a CDP message, it PROCESSES and DISCARDS the message. It does NOT forward it to other devices.
- By M·∫∑c ƒë·ªãnh, CDP Messages are sent once every **60 seconds**
- By M·∫∑c ƒë·ªãnh, the CDP hold-time is **180 seconds.** If a message isn‚Äôt received from a neighbor for 180 seconds, the neighbor is REMOVED from the CDP Neighbor Table
- CDPv2 messages are sent by M·∫∑c ƒë·ªãnh

CDP NEIGHBOR TABLES

![image](https://github.com/psaumur/CCNA/assets/106411237/00cd814e-0255-4fac-ac71-3e50054f813c)

‚ÄúDevice ID‚Äù = What devices were DISCOVERED by CDP

‚ÄúLocal Intrface‚Äù = What LOCAL device Giao di·ªán the neighbors are connected to

‚ÄúHoldtime‚Äù = Hold-time countdown in seconds (0 = device removed from table)

‚ÄúCapabilities‚Äù = Refers to Capability Codes table (located above output)

‚ÄúPlatform‚Äù = Displays the MODEL of the Neighbor Device

‚ÄúC·ªïng ID‚Äù = Neighbor ports that LOCAL device is connected to

‚ÄúVersion‚Äù = shows what version of Cisco‚Äôs IOS is running on the device

CDP C·∫•u h√¨nh COMMANDS

![image](https://github.com/psaumur/CCNA/assets/106411237/393b2680-2304-4c8e-9180-88cc5fefbfd8)

- CDP is GLOBALLY ENABLED, by M·∫∑c ƒë·ªãnh
- CDP is also ENABLED on each Giao di·ªán, by M·∫∑c ƒë·ªãnh
- To K√≠ch ho·∫°t / V√¥ hi·ªáu h√≥a CDP globally: `R1(config)# [no] cdp run`
- To K√≠ch ho·∫°t / V√¥ hi·ªáu h√≥a CDP on specific interfaces : `R1(config-if)# [no] cdp enable`
- Configure the CDP timer: `R1(config)# cdp time *seconds*`
- Configure the CDP holdtime: `R1(config)# cdp holdtime *seconds*`
- K√≠ch ho·∫°t / V√¥ hi·ªáu h√≥a CDPv2: `R1(config)# [no] cdp advertise-v2`

LINK LAYER DISCOVERY Giao th·ª©c (LLDP)

- LLDP is an INDUSTRY STANDARD Giao th·ª©c (IEEE 802.1AB)
- It is usually DISABLED on Cisco devices, by M·∫∑c ƒë·ªãnh, so it must be manually ENABLED
- A device can run CDP and LLDP at the same time

<aside>
üí° LLDP Messages are periodically sent to Multicast ƒê·ªãa ch·ªâ MAC `0180.c200.000E`

</aside>

- When a DEVICE receives an LLDP message, it PROCESSES and DISCARDS the message. It does NOT forward it to OTHER DEVICES
- By M·∫∑c ƒë·ªãnh, LLDP Messages are sent once every **30 seconds**
- By M·∫∑c ƒë·ªãnh, LLDP Holdtime is **120 seconds**
- LLDP has an additional timer called the ‚Äòreinitialization delay‚Äô
    - If LLDP is ENABLED (Globally or on an Giao di·ªán), this TIMER will DELAY the actual initialization of LLDP (**2 seconds,** by M·∫∑c ƒë·ªãnh)

---

LLDP C·∫•u h√¨nh COMMANDS

- LLDP is usually GLOBALLY DISABLED by M·∫∑c ƒë·ªãnh
- LLDP is also DISABLED on each Giao di·ªán, by M·∫∑c ƒë·ªãnh

- To K√≠ch ho·∫°t LLDP GLOBALLY : `R1(config)# lldp run`

- To K√≠ch ho·∫°t LLDP on specific INTERFACES (tx): `R1(config-if)# lldp transmit`
- To K√≠ch ho·∫°t LLDP on specific INTERFACES (rx): `R1(config-if)# lldp receive`

YOU NEED TO K√≠ch ho·∫°t BOTH TO SEND AND RECEIVE (Unless you want to only K√≠ch ho·∫°t SEND or RECEIVE LLDP Messages)

 

- Configure the LLDP timer: `R1(config)# lldp timer *seconds*`
- Configure the LLDP holdtime: `R1(config)# lldp holdtime *seconds*`
- Configure the LLDP reinit timer: `R1(config)# lldp reinit *seconds*`
