# 19. DTP / VTP (Not in Syllabus)

DTP (Dynamic Trunking Giao th·ª©c)

- Giao th·ª©c that allows SWITCHES to negotiate the status of their SWITCHPORTS, without manual C·∫•u h√¨nh, to be:
    - Access PORTS
    - Trunk PORTS

- DTP is ENABLED by M·∫∑c ƒë·ªãnh on all Cisco Switch interfaces

We‚Äôve been manually configuring SWITCHPORTS using :

- ‚Äúswitchport mode Access‚Äù
- ‚Äúswitchport mode Trunk‚Äù

```
üí° 'show interfaces <interface-id> switchport' will show you a switchport‚Äôs settings.
```
For B·∫£o m·∫≠t purposes, **manual C·∫•u h√¨nh** is recommended. DTP should be disabled on ALL SWITCHPORTS

DYNAMIC DESIRABLE:

- This MODE will actively try to form a Trunk with other Cisco SWITCHES.
- Will form a Trunk if connected to another SWITCHPORT in the following modes:
    - ‚Äúswitchport mode Trunk‚Äù
    - ‚Äúswitchport mode dynamic desirable‚Äù
    - ‚Äúswitchport mode dynamic auto‚Äù
    

HOWEVER ‚Ä¶ if the other Giao di·ªán is set to ‚Äústatic Access‚Äù (Access mode), it will NOT form a Trunk, it will be an Access C·ªïng

DYNAMIC AUTO:

- This MODE will NOT actively try to form a Trunk with other Cisco SWITCHES
- Will form a Trunk if connected SWTICH is actively trying to form a Trunk.
- It will form a Trunk with a SWITCHPORT in the following modes:
    - ‚Äúswitchport mode Trunk‚Äù
    - ‚Äúswitchport mode dynamic desirable‚Äù

Trunk to Access connection will operate in a **Mismatched Mode**.

This C·∫•u h√¨nh does NOT work and SHOULD result in an error. Traffic will NOT work.

DTP will NOT form a Trunk with:

a Router

a PC

etcetera ‚Ä¶

The SWITCHPORT will be in Access Mode only!

OLD SWITCHES:

- ‚Äúswitchport mode dynamic desirable‚Äù  = M·∫∑c ƒë·ªãnh Qu·∫£n tr·ªã mode.

NEWER SWITCHES:

- ‚Äúswitchport mode dynamic auto‚Äù = M·∫∑c ƒë·ªãnh Qu·∫£n tr·ªã mode.

C√°ch V√¥ hi·ªáu h√≥a DTP NEGOTIATION ON AN Giao di·ªán:

- ‚Äúswitchport nonegotiate‚Äù
- ‚Äúswitchport mode Access‚Äù

It is a B·∫£o m·∫≠t recommendation to V√¥ hi·ªáu h√≥a DTP on all SWITCHPORTS and manually configure them as Access or Trunk ports.

ƒê√≥ng g√≥i:

SWITCHES that support both:

- 802.1Q
- ISL

Trunk ƒê√≥ng g√≥i can use DTP to negotiate the ƒê√≥ng g√≥i they will use.

- Negotiation is Enabled by M·∫∑c ƒë·ªãnh

```
üí° 'switchport trunk encapsulation negotiate'
```    

- ISL is favored over 802.1Q
    - If BOTH SWITCHES support ISL, ISL will be selected.
- DTP frames are sent in:
    - VLAN1 when using ISL
    - VLAN g·ªëc when using 802.1Q (the M·∫∑c ƒë·ªãnh VLAN g·ªëc is VLAN1, however)

---

VTP (VLAN Trunking Giao th·ª©c)

In Privileged EXEC mode:

```
üí° #show vtp status
```

- Giao th·ª©c for configuring VLANs on a Central Switch
    - A SERVER that other SWITCHES synch. to (auto configuring by connection)
- Other switches (VTP CLIENTS) will synchronize their VLAN database to the SERVER
- Designed for large networks with many VLANs (reduces manual C·∫•u h√¨nh)
- RARELY used. Recommended you DO NOT USE it
- There are THREE VTP Versions :

    - v1
        - Does NOT supports Extended VLAN Range 1006-4094
    - v2
        - Does NOT supports Extended VLAN Range 1006-4094
        - Supports Token Ring VLANs ; otherwise similar to V1
    - v3
        - Supports Extended VLAN Range 1006-4094
        - CLIENTS store VLAN dBase in NVRAM

- There are **THREE VTP modes**:
    - SERVER
    - CLIENT
    - TRANSPARENT

- Cisco SWITCHES operate in VTP SERVER mode, by M·∫∑c ƒë·ªãnh

VTP SERVERS:

- Can ADD / MODIFY / DELETE VLANs
- Store the VLAN dBase in NVRAM
- Increase Revision Number every time VLAN is Added / Modified / Deleted
- Advertises **Latest Version** of VLAN dBase on Trunk interfaces.
- VTP CLIENTS synchronize their VLAN dBase to it
- **VTP SERVERS also function as VTP CLIENTS**
    - **THEREFORE, a VTP SERVER will synchronize to another VTP SERVER with a higher Revision Number**

<aside>
üö® One danger of VTP:
Connecting an old Switch with higher Revision Number to M·∫°ng (and if the VTP Domain Name matches), all SWITCHES in Domain will synchronize their VLAN dBase to Switch

</aside>


VTP CLIENTS:

```
üí° (config)# vtp mode client
```

- Cannot Add / Modify / Delete VLANs
- Does NOT store the VLAN database in NVRAM
    - **VTP v3 CLIENTS DO**
- Will synchronize their VLAN dBase to the SERVER with the highest version number in their VTP Domain
- Advertise their VLAN dBase and forward VTP Advertisements to other CLIENTS over Trunk Ports

VTP TRANSPARENT MODE:

```
üí° (config)# vtp mode transparent
```

- Does NOT participate in VTP Domain (does NOT sync VLAN database)
- Maintains own VLAN dBase in NVRAM.
- Can Add / Modify / Delete VLANs
- Won‚Äôt Advertise to other SWITCHES
- Will forward VTP advertisements to SWITCHES in the same Domain as it.

---

VTP DOMAINS

If a Switch with no VTP Domain (Domain NULL) receives a VTP advertisement with a VTP Domain name, it will automatically join that VTP Domain

If a Switch receives a VTP advertisement in the same VTP domain with a higher revision number, it will update it‚Äôs VLAN database to match

---

REVISION NUMBERS:

There are TWO ways to RESET a REVISION NUMBER to 0:

- Change VTP Domain to an unused Domain
- Change VTP mode to TRANSPARENT

---

VTP VERSION NUMBER

```
üí° (config)#vtp version <version number>
```
  
Changing the Version # will force sync/update all connected SWITCHES to the latest Version #
