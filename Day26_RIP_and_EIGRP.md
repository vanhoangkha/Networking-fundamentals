# 25. RIP AND EIGRP (IGP : DYNAMIC VECTOR)

ƒê·ªãnh tuy·∫øn INFORMATION Giao th·ª©c (RIP)

- ƒê·ªãnh tuy·∫øn Information Giao th·ª©c (Industry Standard)
- is a DISTANCE VECTOR IGP
    - uses ƒê·ªãnh tuy·∫øn-By-Rumor logic to learn/share routes
- Uses HOP COUNT as it‚Äôs Metric (One Router = One Hop)  Bandwidth is irrelevant
- MAX HOP COUNT is 15 (anything more is considered unreachable)
- Has THREE VERSIONS:
    - RIPv1 and RIPv2; used for IPv4
    - RIPng (RIP Next Generation) used for IPv6
- Uses TWO MESSAGE TYPES:
    - REQUEST :
        - To ask RIP-ENABLED neighbour ROUTERS to send their ƒê·ªãnh tuy·∫øn TABLE
    - RESPONSE:
        - To SEND the LOCAL Router‚Äôs ƒê·ªãnh tuy·∫øn TABLE to neighbouring ROUTERS

By Default, RIP-Enabled ROUTERS will share their ƒê·ªãnh tuy·∫øn TABLE every 30 seconds

RIPv1 and RIPv2

RIPv1:

- Only advertises *classful addresses* (Class A, Class B, Class C)
- Doesn‚Äôt support VLSM, CIDR
- Doesn‚Äôt include Network con MASK information in ADVERTISEMENTS (RESPONSE messages)
    - Example:
        - 10.1.1.0/24 will become 10.0.0.0 (Class A Address, so assumed to be /8)
        - 172.16.192.0/18 will become 172.16.0.0 (Class B Address, so assumed to be /16)
        - 192.168.1.40/30 will become 172.168.1.0 (Class C Address, so assumed to be /24)
- Messages are Broadcast to 255.255.255.255

RIPv2:

- Supports VLSM, CIDR
- Includes Network con MASK information in ADVERTISEMENTS
- Messages are **Multicast** to 224.0.0.9
    - Broadcast Messages are delivered to ALL devices on the local Network
    - Multicast Messages are delivered only to devices to have joined that specific ***Multicast group***

CONFIGURING RIP

![image](https://github.com/psaumur/CCNA/assets/106411237/1d14ec8b-121c-4666-b608-1e5d1889424c)

The **‚ÄúNetwork‚Äù** L·ªánh tells the Router to:

- Look for INTERFACES with an ƒê·ªãa ch·ªâ IP that is in the specific RANGE
- ACTIVATES RIP on the INTERFACES that fall in the RANGE
- Form ADJACENCIES with connected RIP neighbors
- Advertise the **Network PREFIX of the Interface** (NOT the prefix in the ‚ÄúNetwork‚Äù L·ªánh)

The OSPF and EIGRP **‚ÄúNetwork‚Äù** commands operate in the same way

Because the RIP ‚ÄúNetwork‚Äù L·ªánh is CLASSFUL. It will automatically convert to CLASSFUL networks

- 10.0.0.0 is assumed to be 10.0.0.0/8
- R1 will look for ANY INTERFACES with an ƒê·ªãa ch·ªâ IP that matches 10.0.0.0/8 (because it is /8 it only needs to match the FIRST 8 bits)
- 10.0.12.1 and 10.0.13.1 both match SO RIP is ACTIVATED on G0/0 and G0/1
- R1 then forms ADJACENCIES with its neighbors R2 and R3
- R1 ADVERTISES 10.0.12.0/30 and 10.0.13.0/30 (NOT 10.0.0.0/8) to it‚Äôs RIP neighbors

- Because the ‚ÄúNetwork‚Äù L·ªánh is CLASSFUL, 172.16.0.0 is assumed to be 172.16.0.0/16
- R1 will look for ANY INTERFACES that match 172.16.0.0/16
- 172.16.1.14 matches, so R1 will ACTIVATE RIP on G2/0
- There are NO RIP neighbors connected to G2/0 so no NEW ADJACENCIES are formed
    - Although there are NO RIP neighbors, R1 will still send ADVERTISEMENTS out of G2/0.
    - This is unnecessary traffic, so G2/0 should be configured as a **passive Interface**

- the ‚Äúpassive-Interface‚Äù L·ªánh tells the Router to stop sending RIP advertisements out of the specified Interface (G2/0)
- However, the Router will continue to ADVERTISE the Network prefix of the Interface (172.16.1.0/28) to it‚Äôs RIP neighbors (R2, R3)
- You should ALWAYS use this L·ªánh on INTERFACES which don‚Äôt have any RIP neighbors
- EIGRP and OSPF both have the same passive Interface functionality, using the same L·ªánh.

To SHARE this Default Tuy·∫øn ƒë∆∞·ªùng with R1‚Äôs RIP neighbors, using this L·ªánh:

RIP doesn‚Äôt care about Interface AD cost (RIP cost is 120), only ‚Äúhops‚Äù.

Since both have an equal number of ‚Äúhops‚Äù, both paths appear in the Default Tuy·∫øn ƒë∆∞·ªùng (Gateway of Last Resort)

ENHANCED INTERIOR Gateway ƒê·ªãnh tuy·∫øn Giao th·ª©c (EIGRP)

- Enhanced Interior Gateway ƒê·ªãnh tuy·∫øn Giao th·ª©c
- is a DISTANCE VECTOR IGP
- Was Cisco proprietary, but Cisco has now published it openly so other vendor can implement it on their equipment
- Considered an ‚Äúadvanced‚Äù / ‚Äúhybrid‚Äù DISTANCE VECTOR ƒê·ªãnh tuy·∫øn Giao th·ª©c
- Much faster than RIP in reacting to changes in the Network
- Does NOT have the 15 ‚Äòhop count‚Äô limit of RIP
- Sends messages using Multicast ADDRESS **224.0.0.10 (Memorize this number)**
- Is the ONLY IGP that can perform **unequal**-cost load-balancing (by Default, it performs ECMP load-balancing over 4 paths like RIP)

Configuration OF EIGRP

‚ÄúRouter EIGRP <Autonomous System number>‚Äù

- The AS (Autonomous System) number MUST MATCH between ROUTERS or they will NOT form an ADJACENCY and share Tuy·∫øn ƒë∆∞·ªùng information
- Auto-summary might be ENABLED or DISABLED by Default; depending on the Router/IOS version. If ENABLED, V√¥ hi·ªáu h√≥a it.
- The **‚ÄúNetwork‚Äù** L·ªánh will assume a CLASSFUL ADDRESS, if you don‚Äôt specify the Network con MASK
- EIGRP uses a *wildcard mask* instead of a regular Network con mask

A WILDCARD MASK is an ‚Äúinverted‚Äù Network con MASK

- All 1‚Äôs in the Network con MASK are 0 in the equivalent WILDCARD MASK.
- All 0s in the Network con MASK are 1 in the equivalent WILDCARD MASK.

‚Äú0‚Äù in the WILDCARD MASK = BITS MUST MATCH !

‚Äú1‚Äù in the WILDCARD MASK = Do not have to match

‚ÄúRouter ID‚Äù

Router ID order of priority:

- Manual Configuration
- Highest ƒê·ªãa ch·ªâ IP on a LOOPBACK Interface
- Highest ƒê·ªãa ch·ªâ IP on a PHYSICAL Interface

‚ÄúDistance‚Äù (AD)

EIGRP has TWO VALUES:

- Internal = 90
- External = 170

MEMORIZE THESE VALUES!

NOTE the large Metric numbers. This is a DOWNSIDE to EIGRP - even on small networks!

---

EIGRP Metric

- By Default, EIGRP uses BANDWIDTH and DELAY to calculate Metric
- Default ‚ÄúK‚Äù values are:
    - K1 = 1, K2 = 0, K3 = 1, K4 = 0, K5 = 0

üí° Simplified calculation : Metric = BANDWIDTH (Slowest Link) + DELAY (of ALL LINKS)

---

EIGRP TERMINOLOGY

- **Feasible Distance** = This Router‚Äôs Metric value to the Tuy·∫øn ƒë∆∞·ªùng‚Äôs DESTINATION
- **Reported Distance** (aka **Advertised Distance**) = The neighbor‚Äôs Metric value to the Tuy·∫øn ƒë∆∞·ªùng‚Äôs DESTINATION

![image](https://github.com/psaumur/CCNA/assets/106411237/436ba2c2-43e7-4fea-a527-f88a8e4460bc)

- **Successor =** the Tuy·∫øn ƒë∆∞·ªùng with the LOWEST Metric to the DESTINATION (the best Tuy·∫øn ƒë∆∞·ªùng)
- **Feasible Successor** = An alternate Tuy·∫øn ƒë∆∞·ªùng to the DESTINATION (not the best Tuy·∫øn ƒë∆∞·ªùng) which meets the *feasibility condition*

**FEASIBILITY CONDITION** : A Tuy·∫øn ƒë∆∞·ªùng is considered a ***Feasible Successor*** if it‚Äôs ***Reported Distance*** is LOWER than the Successor Tuy·∫øn ƒë∆∞·ªùng‚Äôs ***Feasible distance***

EIGRP : UNEQUAL-COST LOAD-BALANCED

![image](https://github.com/psaumur/CCNA/assets/106411237/23a2045b-a925-4f75-b0f8-78cbae2aa1e2)

‚Äúmaximum Metric variance 1‚Äù = the Default value

Variance 1 = only ECMP (Equal-Cost Multiple Path) load-balancing will be performed

![image](https://github.com/psaumur/CCNA/assets/106411237/824dac1d-38dc-4e7e-bb48-b382918230ff)

Variance 2 = ***feasible successor*** routes with an FD up to 2x the ***successor*** Tuy·∫øn ƒë∆∞·ªùng‚Äôs FD can be used to load-balance

üí° EIGRP will only perform UNEQUAL-COST LOAD-BALANCING over ***feasible successor*** ROUTES. If a Tuy·∫øn ƒë∆∞·ªùng doesn‚Äôt meet the ***feasibility condition***, it will NEVER be selected for load-balancing, regardless of **variance**
