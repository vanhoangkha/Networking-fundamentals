- VIRTUAL Định tuyến AND FORWARDING (VRF) is used to DIVIDE a SINGLE Router into MULTIPLE VIRTUAL ROUTERS
    - Similar to how VLANs are used to divide a SINGLE Switch (LAN) into MULTIPLE VIRTUAL SWITCHES (VLANs)
- It does this by allowing a Router to build MULTIPLE SEPARATE Định tuyến TABLES
    - INTERFACES (LAYER 3 only) and ROUTERS are configured to be in a specific VRF (aka *VRF INSTANCE*)
    - Router INTERFACES, SVIs and ROUTED PORTS on MULTILAYER SWITCHES can be configured in a VRF
- TRAFFIC in one VRF cannot be forwarded out of an Giao diện in another VRF
    - As an exception, VRF LEAKING can be configured to allow traffic to pass BETWEEN VRFs
- VRF is commonly used to facilitate MPLS (Multiple Giao thức Label Switching)
    - The kind of VRF we are talking about is VRF-Lite (VRF without MPLS)
- VRF is commonly used by SERVICE PROVIDERS to allow ONE DEVICE to carry traffic from MULTIPLE CUSTOMERS
    - Each CUSTOMER’S TRAFFIC is isolated from the OUTSIDE
    - CUSTOMER IP ADDRESSES can overlap without issue
