# 20. SPANNING TREE GIAO TH·ª®C (STP) : PART 1

REDUNDANCY IN NETWORKS

- Essential in Network design
- Modern networks are expected to run 24/7/265; even a short downtime can be disastrous for business.
- If one Network component fails, you must ensure that other components will take over with little or no downtime.
- As much as possible, you must implement REDUNDANCY at every possible point in the Network

AN EXAMPLE OF A POORLY DESIGNED Network

NOTE the many single-point failures that could occur (single connections)

A BETTER Network DESIGN

UNFORTUNATELY : 

- Most PCS only have a single Network Interface card (NIC), so they can only be plugged into a single Switch. However, important SERVERS typically have multiple NICs, so they can be plugged into multiple SWITCHES for redundancy!

So HOW can all this redundancy be a BAD thing?

FLOODED WITH ARP REQUESTS (Red = Clockwise Loops // Purple = Counter-Clockwise Loops)

Network Congestion isn‚Äôt the only problem.

Each time a Khung arrives on a SWITCHPORT, the Switch uses the SOURCE ƒê·ªãa ch·ªâ MAC field to ‚Äúlearn‚Äù the ƒê·ªãa ch·ªâ MAC and update it‚Äôs ƒê·ªãa ch·ªâ MAC TABLE.

When frames with the same SOURCE ƒê·ªãa ch·ªâ MAC repeatedly arrive on different interfaces, the Switch is continuously updating the Interface in it‚Äôs ƒê·ªãa ch·ªâ MAC TABLE.

This is called ƒê·ªãa ch·ªâ MAC FLAPPING

So how we design a Network, with redundant paths, that doesn‚Äôt result in LAYER 2 LOOPS.

Spanning Tree Giao th·ª©c is one solution

STP (Spanning Tree Giao th·ª©c) : 802.1D

- ‚ÄúClassic Spanning Tree Giao th·ª©c‚Äù is IEEE **802.1D**
- SWITCHES from ALL vendors run STP by Default
- STP prevents LAYER 2 loops by placing redundant PORTS in a BLOCKING state, essentially disabling the Interface
- These INTERFACES act as backups that can enter a FORWARDING state if an active (=currently forwarding) Interface fails.
- INTERFACES in a BLOCKING state only send or receive STP messages (called BPDUs = Bridge Giao th·ª©c Data Units)

üí° Spanning Tree Giao th·ª©c still uses the term ‚ÄúBridge‚Äù. However, when use the term ‚ÄúBridge‚Äù, we really mean ‚ÄúSwitch‚Äù. BRIDGES are not used in modern networks.

ORANGE Interface is ‚ÄúBLOCKED‚Äù causing a break in the loops

If changes occur in the connections, the traffic will adjust the C·∫•u tr√∫c m·∫°ng.

- By selecting WHICH ports are FORWARDING and which ports are BLOCKING, STP creates a single path TO / FROM each point in the Network. This prevents LAYER 2 Loops.
- There is a set process that STP uses to determine which ports should be FORWARDING and which should be BLOCKING
- STP-enabled SWITCHES send / receive ‚ÄúHello BPDUs‚Äù out of all INTERFACES
    - The Default timer is : ONCE every TWO seconds per Interface!
- If a Switch receives a ‚ÄúHello BPDU‚Äù on an Interface, it knows that Interface is connected to another Switch (ROUTERS, PCs, etc. do NOT use STP so do not send ‚ÄúHello BPDUs‚Äù)

---

WHAT ARE BPDUs USED FOR?

- SWITCHES use one field in the STP BPDU, the Bridge ID field, to elect a Bridge g·ªëc for the Network
- The Switch with the lowest Bridge ID becomes the Bridge g·ªëc
- ALL PORTS on the Bridge g·ªëc are put in a FORWARDING state, and other SWITCHES in the C·∫•u tr√∫c m·∫°ng must have a path to reach the Bridge g·ªëc

To REDUCE the Bridge PRIORITY, we can only change it in units of 4096 !

In THIS C·∫•u tr√∫c m·∫°ng, SW1 becomes the Bridge g·ªëc due to it‚Äôs ƒê·ªãa ch·ªâ MAC being LOWEST

(Hex ‚ÄúA‚Äù = 10)

![image](https://github.com/psaumur/CCNA/assets/106411237/b1e1a69d-4b9c-46bf-9b77-f30b9f7c3933)


ALL INTERFACES on the Bridge g·ªëc are DESIGNATED PORTS.

DESIGNATED PORTS ARE IN A FORWARDING STATE!

Bridge g·ªëc

- When a Switch is powered on, it assumes it is the Bridge g·ªëc
- It will only give up its position if it receives a ‚ÄúSUPERIOR‚Äù BPDU (lower Bridge ID)
- Once the C·∫•u tr√∫c m·∫°ng has converged and all SWITCHES agree on the Bridge g·ªëc, only the Bridge g·ªëc sends BPDUs
- Other SWITCHES in the Network will forward these BPDUs, but will not generate their own original BPDUs

---

Spanning Tree Giao th·ª©c STEPS

1) One Switch is elected as Bridge g·ªëc. All PORTS on the Bridge g·ªëc are DESIGNATED PORTS (FORWARDING STATE)

- Bridge g·ªëc selection order:
    - 1) Lowest Bridge ID
    - 2) Lowest ƒê·ªãa ch·ªâ MAC (in case of Bridge ID tie)

2) Each remaining Switch will select ONE of its INTERFACES to be it‚Äôs ROOT Port (FORWARDING STATE). PORTS across from the ROOT Port are always DESIGNATED PORTS.

- ROOT Port selection order:
    - 1) LOWEST ROOT COST (see STP COST CHART)
    - 2) LOWEST NEIGHBOUR Bridge ID
    - 3) LOWEST NEIGHBOUR Port ID

3) Each remaining COLLISION DOMAIN will select ONE Interface to be a DESIGNATION Port (FORWARDING STATE). The other Port in the COLLISION DOMAIN will NON-DESIGNATED (BLOCKING)

- DESIGNATED Port SELECTION:
    - 1) Interface on Switch with LOWEST ROOT COST
    - 2) Interface on Switch with LOWEST Bridge ID

STP COST CHART

üí° Only OUTGOING INTERFACES toward the Bridge g·ªëc have a STP COST; not RECEIVING INTERFACES. Add up all the OUTGOING Port costs until you reach the Bridge g·ªëc

![image](https://github.com/psaumur/CCNA/assets/106411237/0ee95883-aed8-42a3-ba82-11209ef8cd40)


SW1 is the Bridge g·ªëc so has a STP COST of 0 on ALL INTERFACES

![image](https://github.com/psaumur/CCNA/assets/106411237/35037ae9-3430-44ac-be6d-c8d2a2a42c24)


The PORTS connected to another Switch‚Äôs ROOT Port MUST be DESIGNATED (D). 

Because the ROOT Port Is the Switch‚Äôs path to the Bridge g·ªëc, another Switch must not block it.

STP Port ID (in case of a tie-breaker)

NEIGHBOUR Switch Port ID (in case of a tie-breaker)

(D) = DESIGNATED Port

(R) = ROOT Port

QUIZ

Identify the Bridge g·ªëc and the ROLE of EACH Interface on the Network (ROOT / DESIGNATED / NON-DESIGNATED)

#1

![image](https://github.com/psaumur/CCNA/assets/106411237/62bcf349-dd89-48be-92f6-d6a184edeb6f)


ALL SWITCHES have the same PRIORITY NUMBER (32769)

Tie-breaker goes to the LOWEST ƒê·ªãa ch·ªâ MAC

SW3 has the LOWEST so it‚Äôs the Bridge g·ªëc and ALL it‚Äôs INTERFACES become DESIGNATED

Connections from SW1 (G0/1) and S4 (G0/0) to SW3 become ROOT INTERFACES

Because SW2 has TWO connections to SW1, both of SW1‚Äôs INCOMING interfaces become DESIGNATED.

SW2 G0/2 Interface becomes a ROOT Interface because the G0/0 Interface of SW1 is LOWER than it‚Äôs G0/2 Interface

The remaining interfaces on SW2 become NON-DESIGNATED because it has the HIGHEST ROOT COST (12 = 4x 1 GB connection). INTERFACES they are attached to on other SWITCHES become DESIGNATED

#2

![image](https://github.com/psaumur/CCNA/assets/106411237/ae382ec2-9c0f-4673-94b5-5d1411c8db6b)


SW4 has the LOWEST Priority Number so it is designated Bridge g·ªëc

All of SW4 INTERFACES become DESIGNATED

SW2 G0/0 becomes ROOT Port because SW4 G0/0 connection is a LOWER NUMBER than G0/1. 

SW3 G0/1 becomes ROOT Port

SW1 G0/1 becomes ROOT Port because G0/1 cost is LESS than Fa1/0 and 2/0

EACH remaining Port will be either DESIGNATED or NON-DESIGNATED

SW1 Fa1/0 and 2/0 become NON-DESIGNATED since they have a HIGHER STP COST (38) than SW2 outbound ports (8) making SW2 Fa1/0 and 2/0 DESIGNATED

SW2 remaining connection, G0/1, NON-DESIGNATED
