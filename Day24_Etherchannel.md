# 23. ETHERCHANNEL

l√† g√¨ ETHERCHANNEL?

ETHERCHANNEL allows you to GROUP multiple physical INTERFACES into a group which operates as a SINGLE LOGICAL Interface - so they BEHAVE as if they are a single Interface

A LAYER 2 ETHERCHANNEL is a group of Switch PORTS which operate as a SINGLE Interface

A LAYER 3 ETHERCHANNEL is a group of ROUTED PORTS which operate as a SINGLE Interface which you assign an ƒê·ªãa ch·ªâ IP to.

When the bandwidth of the INTERFACES connected to END HOSTS is greater than the bandwidth of the connection to the DISTRIBUTION Switch(es), this is called **OVERSUBSCRIPTION.** 

Some OVERSUBSCRIPTION is acceptable, but too much will cause congestion.

- If you connect TWO SWITCHES together with multiple links, ALL except ONE will be DISABLED by Spanning Tree Giao th·ª©c (Green Lights vs. Orange Lights above on ASW1)

WHY?

- If ALL of ASW1s INTERFACES were FORWARDING, LAYER 2 LOOPS would form between ASW1 and DSW1, leading to a Broadcast STORM (Bad!)
- Other links will be unused unless the active link fails. In that case, one of the inactive link will start forwarding.

An ETHERCHANNEL (in Network C·∫•u tr√∫c m·∫°ng diagrams) is represented like THIS (circle around multi-connections)

- ETHERCHANNEL groups multiple channels together to act as a SINGLE Interface
- STP will treat this GROUP as a SINGLE Interface

(All INTERFACES Green!)

TRAFFIC using ETHERCHANNEL will be load-balanced among the physical INTERFACES in the group.

An algorithm is used to determine WHICH TRAFFIC will use WHICH physical Interface (more details later)

Some other names for an ETHERCHANNEL are:

- Port CHANNEL
- LAG (Link Aggregation Group)

HOW DOES AN ETHERCHANNEL LOAD-BALANCE?

- ETHERCHANNEL load-balances based on **‚Äúflows‚Äù**
- A ‚Äúflow‚Äù is a communication between TWO NODES in the Network
- FRAMES in the same ‚Äúflow‚Äù will be FORWARDED using the SAME physical Interface
- If FRAMES in the same ‚Äúflow‚Äù were FORWARDED using different physical INTERFACES, some FRAMES may arrive at the DESTINATION out of order/sequence, which can cause problems.
- You can CHANGE the INPUTS used in the Interface SELECTION calculation (for ‚Äúflows‚Äù)
    - INPUTS that can be used:
        - SOURCE ƒê·ªãa ch·ªâ MAC
        - DESTINATION ƒê·ªãa ch·ªâ MAC
        - SOURCE and DESTINATION ƒê·ªãa ch·ªâ MAC
        - SOURCE ƒê·ªãa ch·ªâ IP
        - DESTINATION ƒê·ªãa ch·ªâ IP
        - SOURCE and DESTINATION ƒê·ªãa ch·ªâ IP

C√°ch CONFIGURE LAYER 2 / LAYER 3 ETHERCHANNELS

There are THREE methods of ETHERCHANNEL Configuration on Cisco SWITCHES

**PAgP (Port Aggregation Giao th·ª©c)**

- Cisco proprietary Giao th·ª©c
- Dynamically negotiates the creation/maintenance of the ETHERCHANNEL (like DTP does for trunks)

üí° **LACP (Link Aggregation Control Giao th·ª©c)**
- Industry standard Giao th·ª©c (IEEE 802.3ad)
- Dynamically negotiates the creation/maintenance of the ETHERCHANNEL (like DTP does for trunks)


**Static EtherChannel**

- A Giao th·ª©c isn‚Äôt used to determine if an EtherChannel should be formed
- Interfaces are statically configured to form an EtherChannel

Up to 8 INTERFACES can be formed into a single ETHERCHANNEL (LACP allows up to 16 but only 8 will be ACTIVE, the other 8 will in STANDBY mode, waiting for an active Interface to fail)

PAgP Configuration

üí° L∆∞u √Ω r·∫±ng ‚Äúauto‚Äù and ‚Äúdesirable‚Äù are the ONLY available modes for PAgP

PAgP negotiations to form an ETHERCHANNEL


üí° AWS1(config-if-range)# channel-group 1 mode desirable.
Creating a Port-channel Interface Port-channel1

Shows up in the Interface as ‚ÄúPort-channel1‚Äù

![image](https://github.com/psaumur/CCNA/assets/106411237/bc0c1190-9e39-4ea2-923c-b29e03e9d40a)

The ‚Äúchannel-group‚Äù number has to MATCH for member INTERFACES on the same Switch.

It DOESN‚ÄôT have to MATCH the ‚Äúchannel-group‚Äù number on the OTHER Switch!

üí° (channel-group 1 on AWS1 can form an ETHERCHANNEL with channel-group 2 on DSW1)

---

LACP Configuration

![image](https://github.com/psaumur/CCNA/assets/106411237/ba4adcf6-dec5-456f-b8d7-ab4e6b722cbf)

üí° L∆∞u √Ω r·∫±ng ‚Äúactive‚Äù and ‚Äúpassive‚Äù are the ONLY available modes for LACP

LACP negotiations for form an ETHERCHANNEL

The ‚Äúchannel-group‚Äù number has to MATCH for member INTERFACES on the same Switch.

It DOESN‚ÄôT have to MATCH the ‚Äúchannel-group‚Äù number on the OTHER Switch!

üí° (channel-group 1 on AWS1 can form an ETHERCHANNEL with channel-group 2 on DSW1)

STATIC ETHERCHANNEL Configuration

![image](https://github.com/psaumur/CCNA/assets/106411237/92db26e7-21ae-40c6-89ee-abe0197ed8ad)

üí° L∆∞u √Ω r·∫±ng ‚Äúon‚Äù is the ONLY available mode for STATIC ETHERCHANNEL

ON mode only works with ON Mode

ON + desirable = DOES NOT WORK)

ON + active = DOES NOT WORK

C√°ch MANUALLY CONFIGURE THE NEGOTIATION Giao th·ª©c

![image](https://github.com/psaumur/CCNA/assets/106411237/83ef9bc8-4bd4-4dd3-b28e-83439ba96860)

TWO OPTIONS: 

- LACP Giao th·ª©c
- PAgP Giao th·ª©c

(Above shows a Giao th·ª©c mismatch error because LACP does not support ‚Äúdesirable‚Äù - only PAgP does)

(‚Äúchannel-group 1 mode active‚Äù works because LACP supports ‚Äúactive‚Äù)

AFTER CONFIGURING THE ETHERCHANNEL MODE

CONFIGURING THE Port Interface

![image](https://github.com/psaumur/CCNA/assets/106411237/c485cdf1-f0ed-44b8-8c91-c0553bf6d82d)

‚Äúshow running-config‚Äù shows ‚ÄúInterface Port-channel1‚Äù in the Configuration

![image](https://github.com/psaumur/CCNA/assets/106411237/6adda3dd-6408-445f-bb3f-61847b3920b6)

üí° NOTE the PHYSICAL INTERFACES (g0/0-g0/3) were auto-configured by the Port-channel1 Configuration!

---

IMPORTANT NOTES ABOUT ETHERCHANNEL Configuration

- Member INTERFACES must have matching CONFIGURATIONS
    - Same DUPLEX (Full / Half)
    - Same SPEED
    - Same SWITCHPORT mode (Access / Trunk)
    - Same allowed VLANs / VLAN g·ªëc (for Trunk interfaces)

- If an Interface‚Äôs configurations do NOT MATCH the others, it will be EXCLUDED from the ETHERCHANNEL

VERIFYING STATUS OF ETHERCHANNEL

üí° ‚Äúshow etherchannel summary‚Äù

![image](https://github.com/psaumur/CCNA/assets/106411237/9e0edb15-2806-4d51-afc9-ad67ed465a97)

NOTE information at bottom. (‚ÄùSU‚Äù means S - Layer2 + U - in use)

Giao th·ª©c = What Giao th·ª©c the Etherchannel is using (in this case, LACP)

‚ÄúPorts‚Äù = the list of interfaces in the EtherChannel (P = bundled in Port-channel)

OTHER FLAGS

![image](https://github.com/psaumur/CCNA/assets/106411237/23d92ae1-9cc6-4f3a-9ddf-2ead59705c1c)

Changing one of the Member interfaces using ‚Äúswitchport mode Access‚Äù has made it different than the other members so it is now appearing as ‚Äús‚Äù = suspended

Another useful L·ªánh

üí° ‚Äúshow etherchannel Port-channel‚Äù

NOTE : No SWITCHPORT and NO IP Interface.

Where do we configure the ƒê·ªãa ch·ªâ IP?  Directly on the Port Interface !
