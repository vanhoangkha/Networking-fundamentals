CONSOLE Port Security

- By Default, no password us needed to Access the CLI of a CISCO IOS DEVICE via the CONSOLE Port
- You can CONFIGURE a PASSWORD on the *console line*
    - A USER will have to enter a PASSWORD to Access the CLI via the CONSOLE Port

LAYER 2 Switch Management IP

- LAYER 2 SWITCHES do not perform Gói tin Định tuyến and build a Định tuyến TABLE. They are NOT IP Định tuyến aware
- However, you CAN assign an Địa chỉ IP to an SVI to allow REMOTE CONNECTIONS to the CLI of the Switch (using Telnet or SSH)

Telnet

- Telnet (Teletype Network) is a Giao thức used to REMOTELY Access the CLI of a REMOTE HOST
- Telnet was developed in 1969
- Telnet has been largely REPLACE by SSH, which is MORE Secure

<aside>
💡 Telnet SERVERS listen for Telnet traffic on TCP Port 23

SSH

- SSH (Secure Shell) was developed in 1995 to REPLACE LESS SECURE PROTOCOLS, like Telnet
- SSHv2, a major revision of SSHv1, was released in 2006
- If a DEVICE supports both v1 and v2, it is said to run ‘version 1.99’
- Provides Security features; such as DATA ENCRYPTION and AUTHENTICATION

RSA KEYS

- To Kích hoạt and use SSH, you must first generate an RSA PUBLIC and PRIVATE KEY PAIR
- The KEYS are used for DATA ENCRYPTION / DECRYPTION, AUTHENTICATION, etc.
