# 42. SSH (Secure Shell)

CONSOLE C·ªïng B·∫£o m·∫≠t

- By M·∫∑c ƒë·ªãnh, no password us needed to Access the CLI of a CISCO IOS DEVICE via the CONSOLE C·ªïng
- You can CONFIGURE a PASSWORD on the *console line*
    - A USER will have to enter a PASSWORD to Access the CLI via the CONSOLE C·ªïng

- Alternatively, you can configure the CONSOLE LINE to require USERS to LOGIN using one of the configured USERNAMES on the DEVICE

LAYER 2 Switch Qu·∫£n l√Ω IP

- LAYER 2 SWITCHES do not perform G√≥i tin ƒê·ªãnh tuy·∫øn and build a ƒê·ªãnh tuy·∫øn TABLE. They are NOT IP ƒê·ªãnh tuy·∫øn aware
- However, you CAN assign an ƒê·ªãa ch·ªâ IP to an SVI to allow REMOTE CONNECTIONS to the CLI of the Switch (using Telnet or SSH)

Telnet

- Telnet (Teletype M·∫°ng) is a Giao th·ª©c used to REMOTELY Access the CLI of a REMOTE HOST
- Telnet was developed in 1969
- Telnet has been largely REPLACE by SSH, which is MORE Secure
- Telnet sends data in PLAIN TEXT. NO ENCRYPTION(!)

<aside>
üí° Telnet SERVERS listen for Telnet traffic on TCP C·ªïng 23

SSH

- SSH (Secure Shell) was developed in 1995 to REPLACE LESS SECURE PROTOCOLS, like Telnet
- SSHv2, a major revision of SSHv1, was released in 2006
- If a DEVICE supports both v1 and v2, it is said to run ‚Äòversion 1.99‚Äô
- Provides B·∫£o m·∫≠t features; such as DATA ENCRYPTION and AUTHENTICATION

RSA KEYS

- To K√≠ch ho·∫°t and use SSH, you must first generate an RSA PUBLIC and PRIVATE KEY PAIR
- The KEYS are used for DATA ENCRYPTION / DECRYPTION, AUTHENTICATION, etc.
